Computer vision and machine learning is a revolution in the thought process of the researchers, scientists and even common people. Most of the work once considered to be impossible is now achieved. The applications of computer vision and machine learning in the fields like security, agriculture, education and many other fields are exceptional. Inspite of many achievements, the complete power of computer vision is yet to be explored. This project can be classified under the field of security and surveillance.  A new model is proposed to track the movement in the video footages, gaining the information about motion vectors and using the information to classify the motion into 4 classes: Arcs, Lanes, Converging/Diverging and Random/Block motions. This project uses Motion Information Images and Block wise dominant motion information to classify the motion in the videos.

This project explores the advantages of different optical flow techniques, CNN Models and machine learning models to achieve the goal. Besides achieving the objectives, it experiments the use of different types of optical flow techniques and evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of using them practically. In addition to the implementation of these different techniques, this project evaluates the best model for the approach. The use of different types of CNN models like AlexNet, VGG and ResNet also helps to understand the importance of the architecture in achieving the objective. Nevertheless the use of machine learning models in this scope is an add on advantage to see how different models perform this task.

This project achieves the objectives with promising accuracy from both CNN and Machine learning models. The end result can be used to train a new model for anomaly detection and also general behaviour understand the scene in terms of motion. Also use of this model provides the motion patterns in the scene.
