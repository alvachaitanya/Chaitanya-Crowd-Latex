\unnumberedchapter{Acknowledgements}

Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Deepayan Bhowmik for his time, continuous support and motivation in completing this project. The interest and the knowledge that I gained while working on this project wouldn't be possible without his guidance.

I would also like to thank my second marker Dr. Kevin Swingler for the knowledge that I gained from him throughout the year and his kind comments during the poster presentation. 

I would also take a moment to thank my professors for all the knowledge that I gained through out the year.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my friends and family who believed in me and helped me in every situation of my life.
