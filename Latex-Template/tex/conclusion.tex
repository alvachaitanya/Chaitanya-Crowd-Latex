From the results and the discussions, we can see

\section{Future Work}
This project was implemented and tested on the assumption that the Videos from the different datasets are captured from a fixed lens cameras or the drones capturing the videos from a fixed point of view. There is a scope of improvement by enhancing the model to overcome this exception. In the scenes with less dense population, feature detection of this model captures crowd along with any other movement in the frame. This can be modified by implementing object detecting technique prior to feature detection which can track only human in the frame. This can in turn enhance the quality of the Motion information images. Another scope is to use the MII images and train a different model for anomaly detection.
